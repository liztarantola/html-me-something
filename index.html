                    <p>
                        "Although I love to travel, I dont get very many opportunities to do so.  A few years ago my sister had to go to San Francisco for a conference and asked me to tag along and we would make a vacation out of it. It was one of favorite trips to date, here are some of the highlights! "

                    <p>
                        "My fist day there, my sister was in her conference so I had the day to myself.  It was really foggy that morning, but I walked along the beach and had time to take in my sorroundings. I could see the Golden Gate Bridge through the fog, as well as Alcatrez and I spotted my first destination which was Coit Tower off in the distance.  As I was walking I noticed a seal swimming along next to me as I went.  It was pretty cool."

                    <p>
                        "We spent the next couple of days exploring the city.  The architecture is so pretty and there were so many buildings with murals on them, very cool to look at.  We took a trolly to China Town and after exploring there we walked through the city back to the wharf.  We checked out bookstores, coffeeshops, record stores, anything that caught our eyes.  When we got back to the Wharf, we of course had to go to Guirrardelli's for icecream."

                    <h2>Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our hotel was on the waterfront an area called Fisherman's Wharf.  One if the tourist spots is Pier 39.  There's an old carousel there and a lot of places to shop and terrible things to eat.  I'll clarify, terrible for me but delicious things to eat. Of course we had to go get candy at this giant candy store.  How could you say no?

                        My favorite attraction were these seals that laid out and sunbathed on the wharf all day.  This one looked so relaxed.  They were really funny to watch though.  I went there everyday to watch them while I was in town.

                        There were plenty of performing artists and interesting people on the wharf.  This man sat on a milk crate hiding himself with branches and as unsuspecting tourists walked by he would jump out and scare the heck out them!  It was hilarious, people weren't upset, they all got a kick out of it!

                        On our last day there, we decided to hit Muir Woods to see the redwood forest.  It's pretty unreal seeing trees this massive.  You can see how tiny my sister looks taking a picture of them!

                        "My sister loves absolutely loves aquariums, and Monteray has a phenominal one.  I could not leave the west coast without driving down the gorgous Highway 1.  So we decided to do both! It is such a beautiful coastline,with the ocean on one side and rolling hills on the other.  I am so grateful we got to do that together!"
